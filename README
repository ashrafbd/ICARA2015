Review Manuscript Preparation

Prospective authors should submit a manuscript of 4 to 6 pages in length, including figures, tables and references. 
The manuscript should summarize the scope of the paper and the primary results and findings, emphasizing new
advances, theories and/or applications so that the program committee will be able to understand the originality 
and the value of the work. 

The recommended structure of the manuscript is as follows:

Title
Authors
Affiliation
Keywords
Introduction: 	this should explain why the topic is important, its value to science, and include a background of the 
work, and a literature review.
Proposed approach: 	this part describes the techniques or methodology used to address the topic.
Results: 	this part contains the innovative results and a brief comparison with the literature. Although projected 
future results may be discussed, this section must deal primarily with achieved findings, not projections. Novelty 
should be stressed.
References: 	the key references should be given, mainly including relevant papers available in the literature 
(not just the list of previous publications of the authors).
Figures and tables may be included where appropriate.
